Connect Four Fast!

This game began as a simple exercise in creating the widely-known game, Connect Four, with JavaScript and Document Object Modeling. Once I had completed the game, I immediately wanted to put my own "spin" on it. So, I implemented a repeating countdown that, when reaching zero, will remove all the player markers from the bottom row of the board and shift the remaining markers down one row.
